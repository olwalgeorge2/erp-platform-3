# Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Phase 0 - Foundations
1.1 Run domain discovery workshops to validate bounded contexts and ubiquitous language documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
1.2 Finalize functional and non-functional requirements, team charters, and delivery conventions.
1.3 Prioritize bounded contexts for the initial release and map capability dependencies.
1.4 Stand up collaborative tooling (work tracking, documentation, ADR process) and agree on Definition of Ready/Done.
1.5 Timebox discovery iterations (e.g., 2-week cadence) and capture open language questions as backlog items rather than blocking progress.
1.6 Refresh the context map and glossary artifacts, linking outcomes back to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and CONTEXT_MAP.md for traceability.
1.7 Schedule architecture and DDD onboarding sessions so delivery teams share the same tactical patterns before implementation begins.
1.8 Define Phase 0 exit criteria and a go/no-go gate (validated language, updated ADR backlog, prioritized risks) to anchor subsequent phases.
1.9 Cross-links: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#domain-driven-design-ddd, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#bounded-contexts, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#context-map.

## 2. Phase 1 - Platform Bootstrap
2.1 Stabilize the Gradle/Kotlin build, shared plugins, and conventions located in build.gradle.kts and build-logic/.
2.2 Configure platform-shared/ and platform-infrastructure/ modules (CQRS, eventing, observability, security scaffolding).
2.3 Establish environment configuration standards and secret management patterns based on .env.example.
2.4 Wire a CI pipeline that executes ktlint, static analysis, and unit test suites on every change.
2.5 Codify phase exit metrics (CI cycle time targets, lint/test pass rates, convention plugin coverage) and document them alongside the build guidance in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md before proceeding.
2.6 Cross-links: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#hexagonal-architecture-ports--adapters, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#build-system, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#gradle-configuration, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#build-conventions.
2.7 Related ADRs: ADR-001 Modular CQRS Implementation.

## 3. Phase 2 - Cross-Cutting Services
3.1 Implement tenancy-identity/ services with OAuth2/OIDC integration, RBAC policies, and tenant resolution middleware.
3.2 Deliver the api-gateway/ for routing, authentication delegation, rate limiting, and centralized logging.
3.3 Publish shared API contracts and error handling guidelines for downstream bounded contexts.
3.4 Validate cross-cutting telemetry, tracing, and audit logging across gateway and identity flows.
3.5 Align security tiers, observability baselines, and shared API SLAs with the guidance in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md so every downstream team inherits consistent non-functional guarantees.
3.6 Run a thin portal/UX spike against the gateway + identity endpoints to gather early user feedback and confirm auth flows before domain services land.
3.7 Cross-links: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#security-architecture, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#authentication--authorization, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#observability.
3.8 Related ADRs: ADR-004 API Gateway Pattern, ADR-005 Multi-Tenancy Data Isolation Strategy.

## 4. Phase 3 - Data & Messaging Backbone
4.1 Provision PostgreSQL schemas per bounded context and automate migrations.
4.2 Deploy the message broker and codify domain event contracts in shared modules.
4.3 Integrate observability stack (metrics, tracing, logging) into Quarkus configuration for all services.
4.4 Document data retention, archival, and recovery strategies aligned with compliance requirements.
4.5 Decide on schema isolation (separate databases vs. schemas vs. hybrid) per context, record the decision as an ADR, and update deployment playbooks accordingly.
4.6 Establish event versioning and schema registry practices so downstream consumers can evolve safely; capture governance in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
4.7 Define RPO/RTO objectives and operational SLOs for data services, using them as the go/no-go criteria for moving into Phase 4.
4.8 Cross-links: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#data-consistency, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#deployment-architecture, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#future-enhancements.
4.9 Related ADRs: ADR-002 Database Per Bounded Context, ADR-003 Event-Driven Integration Between Contexts, ADR-005 Multi-Tenancy Data Isolation Strategy.

## 5. Phase 4 - First Bounded Context Slice
5.1 Select a high-value bounded context (e.g., financial-management/financial-accounting) and model aggregates.
5.2 Implement application services, API endpoints, and persistence adapters for the selected context.
5.3 Expose the slice through the API gateway with authentication, authorization, and validation.
5.4 Create contract, integration, and acceptance tests covering the end-to-end flow.
5.5 Demonstrate adherence to the hexagonal layering standards in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (domain-centric tests, adapters in infrastructure) and record measured service SLIs before scaling work.
5.6 Conduct a formal go/no-go review of architecture assumptions, resilience guardrails, and UX feedback gathered from the Phase 3 spike.
5.7 Cross-links: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#hexagonal-architecture-ports--adapters, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#bounded-contexts, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#testing-strategy.
5.8 Related ADRs: ADR-001 Modular CQRS Implementation, ADR-003 Event-Driven Integration Between Contexts.

## 6. Phase 5 - Incremental Context Rollout
6.1 Expand the initial context to include adjacent subdomains while preserving domain autonomy.
6.2 Onboard additional bounded contexts (inventory, procurement, commerce) via thin vertical slices.
6.3 Coordinate shared-kernel modules and versioned APIs to minimize coupling between teams.
6.4 Integrate portal/ user experiences where applicable and capture UX feedback loops.
6.5 Define the team-scaling model (parallel squads per bounded context, platform enablement guild) and ensure each team completes architecture/DDD enablement training before onboarding.
6.6 Maintain dependency maps and shared language agreements between contexts, updating CONTEXT_MAP.md and relevant ADRs whenever boundaries shift.
6.7 Cross-links: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#bounded-contexts, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#domain-driven-design-ddd, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#context-map.
6.8 Related ADRs: ADR-003 Event-Driven Integration Between Contexts, ADR-005 Multi-Tenancy Data Isolation Strategy.

## 7. Phase 6 - Quality & Resilience
7.1 Increase unit, contract, and Quarkus integration test coverage using tests/ suites.
7.2 Introduce load, chaos, and failure-injection drills to validate resilience and multi-tenant safeguards.
7.3 Establish continuous security scanning, dependency management, and vulnerability triage workflows.
7.4 Maintain living runbooks in docs/runbooks/ and update ADRs in docs/adr/ for significant decisions.
7.5 Track progress against the testing pyramid defined in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, adding architecture tests and automated fitness functions to prevent layering regressions.
7.6 Define quantitative resilience targets (latency, error budget burn, recovery time) and require them to be met before advancing.
7.7 Cross-links: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#testing-strategy, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#security-architecture, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#observability.
7.8 Related ADRs: ADR-001 Modular CQRS Implementation, ADR-003 Event-Driven Integration Between Contexts, ADR-005 Multi-Tenancy Data Isolation Strategy.

## 8. Phase 7 - Deployment & Operations
8.1 Containerize services (JVM or native) and define deployment manifests under deployment/.
8.2 Automate infrastructure provisioning (Terraform/Helm) with staged environments and progressive delivery.
8.3 Implement centralized configuration management, secrets rotation, backups, and disaster recovery rehearsals.
8.4 Define release management, incident response, and SLO dashboards for production readiness.
8.5 Formalize data migration/backfill strategies (if replacing an incumbent system), including rehearsal plans and validation tooling.
8.6 Run a deployment readiness review that verifies platform SLOs, operational runbooks, and data migration rehearsals before go-live sign-off.

8.8 Related ADRs: ADR-002 Database Per Bounded Context, ADR-005 Multi-Tenancy Data Isolation Strategy.

## 9. Phase 8 - Go-Live & Evolution
9.1 Execute performance, scalability, and multi-tenant load testing against production-like data.
9.2 Complete external security and compliance assessments prior to launch.
9.3 Finalize onboarding flows, documentation, and support processes for customer-facing teams.
9.4 Establish a continuous improvement backlog for enhancements, technical debt, and analytics initiatives.

9.6 Feed pilot learnings into updated ADRs, roadmap adjustments, and OKRs to guide the next planning cycle.
9.7 Confirm post-launch success metrics (e.g., p95 latency, support ticket volume, tenant onboarding time) and iterate on the backlog based on observed outcomes.
